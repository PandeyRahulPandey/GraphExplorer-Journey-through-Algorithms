# GraphExplorer: Journey through Algorithms

Live Link: https://poetic-caramel-9c128e.netlify.app/


Welcome to the Graph Algorithm Visualizer project! This tool is designed to help you visualize popular graph algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Dijkstra's algorithm. Whether you're a student studying graph theory or a developer implementing these algorithms, this tool can aid in understanding and debugging.

# Features:-
1.Visualization: See how the algorithms traverse through the graph in real-time.

2.Custom Graphs: Input your own graph or choose from predefined examples.

3.Algorithm Selection: Choose between DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra's algorithm to visualize.

4.Node Highlighting: Easily track the path taken by the algorithm with node highlighting.
